# Image-Processing-Project

Filters are a source of infinite fun and hilarity. These filters make individuals seem adorable on video and are visually appealing. According to a new survey, 90% of young women use filters. Millennials continue to be huge fans of Snapchat filters. In this project, we tend to develop a Real time face filter application which allows the user to apply various face filters over their face. Considering the pandemic fact,  the project will also be holding an additional module where it will be exhibited as a platform for selling face masks online. The user can try the mask on using various mask filters in this augmented environment. After that, the image is captured. Whenever a image is captured, the quality of image tends to go down. Thus, specific image processing techniques are implemented in order to give a more enhanced image.

## Implementation Steps

**STEP 1**
Open the main.py file and run the python script
Before running the script, make sure the image set is available in the directory mentioned in code else change the directory directing to that image set

**STEP 2**
The output console will list a list of filers to choose

**STEP 3**
Select the desired filter and Enter the filter number. The script will run and a window will open showing the filter being applied over the face.

**STEP 4**
Now, run the second script main2.py

**STEP 5**
Once the script starts to run, It capture the window where the face detection is being done and it will process the image.
The image is processed under various image processing techniques, Image Sharpening, Image enhancement and Image Denoising.
Finally, once all the processes are done. The final image will be displayed.

**STEP 6**
Check the directory mentioned in the main2.py to find the saved final image.
